# Design Patterns

### Definition
Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular
design problem in your code.

### Benefits of patterns
Patterns are a toolkit of solutions to common problems in software design. They define a common language that helps your team communicate more efficiently.

### Classification
Design patterns differ by their complexity, level of detail and scale of applicability. In addition, they can be categorized by their intent and divided into three groups.

## Behavioral Patterns

### Strategy
Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.

## Creational Patterns

### Builder
Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

### Prototype
Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.

### Singleton
Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

## Structural Patterns

### Adapter
Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

### Decorator
Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.
